> ðŸ‘½ Power up your libGDX game!

Cyberpunk is a collection of independent, modular, pure-Kotlin libraries to use on top of [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). By offering various utilities and boilerplates, it aims to speed up development and ease the making of prototypes, making it a great fit for game jams!

### Modules

Cyberpunk is all about small, independent modules. Because of the Gradle integration, you can easily import *just* the modules that you need. To properly serve that purpose, every single module is totally independent from all others.

Here are the **current** modules (each one has a *README.md* file):

- audio: Music/Sound asset management and various utilities.
- camera: Various camera styles on the go.
- core: States, state management and transitions. Get up and running quickly!
- image: Image asset management and various utilities.
- physics: Friendly and practical Box2D constructs.
- text: Text positioning helpers.

### Usage

JitPack is used here, so, if you want to import *any* module, add this to your root `build.gradle` file:

```Groovy
allprojects {
  repositories {
    // ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

Now, in order to import single modules, add to the `dependencies` as follows:

```Groovy
compile 'com.github.imXico.cyberpunk:$module:$version'
```

Replace `$module` with the name of the desired library (see above). Likewise, `$version` should be replaced with the desired version. Check out the released versions [here](https://github.com/ImXico/Cyberpunk/releases).

### What About libKTX?

Good question! Indeed, [libKTX](https://github.com/libktx/ktx) is an awesome project! If you're already a libKTX user and you're happy with it, you should definitely stick with it. Same thing would apply if you were to start a larger, *pure Kotlin* project. It provides an *incredible* range of utilities, and makes full use of Kotlin's awesome features!

That being said, if you're looking for a smoother Java interop or are carrying out a game jam, give Cyberpunk a try!
